0 0 0 0 to 8 years ago as a graduate student and I was really excited to move out of Texas where I'd been living for my whole life at that point. And I also was excited about how close Madison was to Chicago because I have friends and family there. Um, and then also the like very well-known natural landscape. I grew up, um doing a lot of hiking and camping with my family and I really wanted to be able to continue that here in Madison. So the Arboretum was a big draw. So that was eight years ago that I moved to Madison. I'm excited to hear that. You also grew up in Texas. Uh, what part of Texas did you grow up in? I grew up in San Antonio and then I lived in Houston and Austin for a little while when I was in college and after college, so you've definitely experienced more of the state than me. But San Antonio is a very cool city. Yeah. I like San Antonio a lot too. Um, so I was able to talk to a handful of people and actually a lot of them said that they were really excited about the community of Madison and kind of what I heard from people was that people find Madison to be a really like warm and welcoming place especially compared to the Midwest. Um, but also one of the things that I was really excited about when I moved to Madison was all the lakes and I've loved being able to take advantage of them throughout the years and people said that they were really excited about how there's kind of a balance between having this like really vibrant downtown area but also all the nature that's around it. So people like that they can have like a really active lifestyle and be able to do like kayaking and fishing and just kind of be out in nature a lot and then another person said that they were really excited about moving to Madison because they were able to have more access to culture and diversity than what they had grown up with in other parts of the state. So kind of like a bigger city feel without it being like too big of a city and then the last thing that I heard from a handful of people was that people are really excited about the food scene in Madison and kind of how there's a lot of local restaurants and that there's not as many chain restaurants as other parts of the state that they might have lived in so people like that they're able to try like a lot of different cuisines and there's just kind of a lot of different things to explore in terms of the food. So Madison has a lot to offer and yeah, I think people are pretty excited about it. Yeah, so it sounds like some of the things that drew you to Madison are also some of the things that draw people to Madison and also it's just really interesting to hear what other people's experiences have been like and you know how they feel about the city. So thank you so much for sharing all of that. Yeah. Thank you for asking. So what's one thing that you like most about living in Madison? I think the thing I like most about living in Madison is the walkability and bikeability of the city. I love that. I don't have to drive to get most places. I can walk or bike and I'm very excited for the spring so I can start biking more often. Um, but I also just really love the like very neighborhood focused community that Madison has and I'm a really big fan of going to the Dane County Farmers Market and I really like that. It's so big and that all the vendors are from Wisconsin. What about you? That's a great question. I think what I like most about Madison is that it's just this really vibrant and like active City but at the same time it still feels really small and that it's still pretty easy to get around. Um, but there's a lot of things to do so I really like that but um, I also love the food scene and I'm a really big fan of the farmers market too. And I think that's one of my favorite things to do on the weekends, but I also love that there's so many different outdoor activities to do so, there's always something to do and it's just a really great place to be and I'm excited to continue exploring it so Madison is just a really special place and I'm excited to continue living here. What's one thing that you would change about Madison? I think the thing I would change about Madison is the lack of public transportation that we have compared to bigger cities.
