So from V6 to V8 to V12. So from 2, 4, 6 to 4, 6, 8, to 8, 10, 12, to 10, 12, 14. So, it's a difference of 2, 2, 2. No, 2, 2, 2. No. So if I have 4, 6, 8, that's V4, V6, V8. Okay, so V4, V6, V8. Let's see. V4, V6, V8. Okay. So, then the next one is 6, 8, 10. Okay, 6, 8, 10. That's V6, V8, V10. So it's 2, 2, 2. No. Wait, no. So, it's 2, 2. Wait, V4, V6, V8. Okay, so V4, V6, V8. Then V6, V8, V10. Okay. So, how do I go from 4 to 6? 2. How do I go from 6 to 8? 2. How do I go from 8 to 10? 2. So it's a + 2, + 2, + 2 pattern. Let's see if that's what's happening. So, from 2, 4, 6. So V2, V4, V6. Okay, V2, V4, V6. Then 4, 6, 8. So V4, V6, V8. Then 6, 8, 10. So V6, V8, V10. Okay. Then 8, 10, 12. So V8, V10, V12. Okay. Then 10, 12, 14. So V10, V12, V14. Okay.
