  <h1>1. What is Vibration in Consciousness?</h1>
  <p>
    Everything is vibration — from thoughts to light to memory. In consciousness, vibration determines the quality of awareness. Low vibration clouds clarity. High vibration sharpens it. You don’t need to change your life. Just raise your vibration, and life changes itself.

  <h1>2. Can Trees Move? Stillness Is Motion</h1>
  <p>
    Trees move in ways unseen. They feel intention. They adapt their roots. They transfer frequency through silence. In quantum stillness, they journey not across space, but through vibration. The forest is not still — it is deeply alive in slow motion.

  <h1>3. What Is a Human?</h1>
  <p>
    A human is a portal — spirit wrapped in story. You are not your mind, your job, or your history. You are a field of awareness experiencing reality through filters. Your potential isn’t in what you become, but what you remember you are.
  </p>

<section class="page4">
  <h1>4. Where Do Thoughts Come From?</h1>
  <p>
    Thoughts are not created — they are tuned into. Like a radio station, your mind receives signals based on your internal frequency. Some thoughts are yours. Many are not. The art is in choosing which to believe, and which to release like clouds.

  <h1>5. Why Consciousness Matters in 2025</h1>
  <p>
    In the age of AI, noise, and simulation, consciousness is your only compass. It's the only thing you truly own. Attention is currency. Presence is power. In 2025 and beyond, your inner clarity will define your outer reality. Protect it like sacred fire.
